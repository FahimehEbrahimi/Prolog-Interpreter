I tested my program against 4 files and redirect the outputs to separate files:

	sml < test1.sml > out1
	sml < test2.sml > out2
	sml < testsuite/monty_python.sml  > monty
	sml < testsuite/flintstones.sml > flintstones


You may want to check these output files to see the algorithm step by step
I used PrintTerm and PrintList to show the steps.

I commented out all print functions. 
You may remove the comments to see the algorithm on your test cases. 

Among my test cases, test2.sml does not print the correct clause. 
But as you can see in "out2" file the algorithm works correctly and the problem is in applying substitution over the collected variables. 
I could not resolve the bug since it works for other cases like "flintstones.sml".
